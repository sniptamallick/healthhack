# LeARning Reimagined 



In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, nearly 6 million public school children transitioned to virtual learning. Many schools, parents, and teachers were unprepared to handle the challenges of distance learning from declining student engagement, zoom fatigue, and decreased learning quality. LeARning Reimagined is here to reimagine distance learning by promoting in-depth, comprehensive science education from the comfort of your home by harnessing the power of AR/VR to bring topics to life!
